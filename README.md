# Quarantini Api

Quarantini is a single-page web application that works with a backend API. The app allows you to log recipes of your favorite cocktails and udpate with comments. The purpose of this web-application is to make home life a little more bearable in these trying times. If you're stuck at home and love craft cocktails, why not experiment with mixology at home and save your recipes online?
